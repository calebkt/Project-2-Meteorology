Project 2 - Meteorology

The goal for this project is outside of simply the scope of coding, but instead the accurate analysis of Bulk Meteorology data in terms of wind speed and rain rate. We are to utilize the M2M method in order to monitor a years worth of data from mooring sites including the Oregon Shelf Surface Mooring (OSSM), and Oregon Offshore Surface Mooring (OOSM). The Bulk Meteorology data specifically analyzes wind speed and rain rate, in parameters of velocity vs precipitation. As well, we use these comparisons in order to plot a cross-correlation between OSSm vs OOSM data in order to understand how different locations compare in terms of similarity. 

Images provided below are considered not rainy if precipitation rate is less then 5mm/hr; not windy if wind speed is less then 2m/s.
